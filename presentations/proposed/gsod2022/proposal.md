# GSoD Proposal 2022 - Scientific Python

**Title**: Create and curate educational content for Scientific Python

## About your organization

With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis. This ecosystem is sustained largely by volunteers working on independent projects with separate mailing lists, websites, roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions, and governance structures.

The Scientific Python project aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare the software projects in this ecosystem for the next decade of data science.

## About your project

### Your project’s problem

There is no shortage of content around the web about how to use and explore different packages in the scientific Python ecosystem. However, some of it is outdated or incomplete, and many times doesn't follow the best practices that would be advocated for by the maintainers of these packages.

In addition, we would like to support not only users, but also contributors and maintainers of these libraries. Currently, a lot of information about how to maintain an open-source project is undocumented, or gets conflated with documentation for contributors.

Our project aims to be the definitive documentation source---for people looking to make use of these libraries in education, research and industry, contribute to them, or maintain them---written, maintained, and improved by the community of developers and users.

### Your project’s scope

*Tell us about what documentation your organization will create, update, or improve. If some work is deliberately not being done, include that information as well. Include a time estimate, and whether you have already identified organization volunteers and a technical writer to work with your project.*

Our goal is to populate the https://learn.scientific-python.org/ website with high-quality content, reviewed, and approved by the maintainers of the libraries in the ecosystem. The main goal of these documents is to centralize information relevant to all (or most) projects in the ecosystem, at the reduced cost of being maintained in one place.

The is a new project and much of the content is adapted from different sources. We would like the documentation to have a unified style and voice.

This project aims to:

- Create, update, or edit content for the https://learn.scientific-python.org/ website
- Identify and document possible gaps in existing content.
- Improve our contributor guide

To ensure this project is successful, it is recommended that the technical writer has some familiarity with at least a few of the core projects of the scientific Python ecosystem (see https://scientific-python.org/specs/core-projects/).

### Measuring your project’s success

*How will you know that your new documentation has helped solve your problem? What metrics will you use, and how will you track them?*

We would consider the project successful if:

- At least 3 documents were updated on learn.scientific-python.org, for each of the profiles we support (users, contributors and maintainers)
- The contributor guide had more information about style and voice for new contributions.

### Timeline

We anticipate the project to be developed over six months including onboarding the technical writer, reviewing existing material,
improving the contributor guide, and editing the documentation.


| Dates | Action Items |
|-------|--------------|
| May | Onboarding |
|June | Review existing documentation |
|July | Update contributor guide |
| August-October | Update and edit content|
| November | Project completion |

## Project budget

| Budget item | Amount | Running Total | Notes/justifications |
|-------------|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Technical writer | 5000.00 | 5000.00 |  |
| TOTAL | | 5000.00 | |

### Additional information

*Include here any additional information that is relevant to your proposal.*

*- Previous experience with technical writers or documentation: If you or any of your mentors have worked with technical writers before, or have developed documentation, mention this in your application. Describe the documentation that you produced and the ways in which you worked with the technical writer. For example, describe any review processes that you used, or how the technical writer's skills were useful to your project. Explain how this previous experience may help you to work with a technical writer in Season of Docs.*
*- Previous participation in Season of Docs, Google Summer of Code or others: If you or any of your mentors have taken part in Google Summer of Code or a similar program, mention this in your application. Describe your achievements in that program. Explain how this experience may influence the way you work in Season of Docs.*

The Scientific Python project is a new initiative, and this is our first time participating in Google Season of Docs. However, the people involved are established members of the Python community, with a vast collective experience in mentoring, managing and maintaining large open source projects. Both mentors Jarrod Millman and Ross Barnowski have mentored many new contributors on multiple projects including NumPy, SciPy, and NetworkX.
Ross has served as a co-mentor for three former GSoD students on the NumPy project, largely related to generating new content for tutorials, as well as refactoring existing user documentation.
